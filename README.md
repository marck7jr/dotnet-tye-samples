# .NET Tye Samples

This repository constains samples based on the tutorials of [.NET Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye).

[Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye) is described as "a developer tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying microservices and distributed applications easier. Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration."

## Current Status

This repository is intended to be used as a documentation process as I learn about how to develop microservices with .NET using [Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye).

I'm planning to add more samples as I learn more about how to use .NET with [Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye) to develop microservices.

The features of this repository are:

- [x] Basic Project Tye configuration.
- [x] Basic microservice development using .NET.
- [x] Redis cache support.
- [x] GRPC support.
- [ ] Message broker support.

Some samples may be imcomplete and may require additional configuration to work.
